- ⬜ **Route Optimization Engine**
  - Geographic clustering of orders (within 2-3km radius)
  - Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) solver for optimal delivery sequence
  - Real-time route recalculation when new orders are placed
  - Dynamic order reassignment for maximum efficiency
  - Traffic-aware routing with real-time data integra
  - **Inefficiency Prevention**
  - **Scenario 1**: Orders on opposite ends of delivery zone
    - Solution: Geographic clustering before assignment
    - Batch orders within proximity zo
  - Dricenario 2**: Driver en route, new order placed nearby
    - Solution: Real-time route recalculation
    - Insert new delivery into existing route if efficient
  - **Scenario 3**: Multiple trips to same area
    - Solution: Time-based batching (5-10 min hold for nea)
    - Predictive order clustering based on histota
  - **Scenarioline/tracker capacity underutilization
    - Sn: Dynamic load balancing across drivers
    -ign orders to optimize overall fleet efficiency
- ⬜ **Real-time Tracking &ion**

  - Customer view of driver location on map
  - Admin view of all active drivers and routes
  - ETA calculations with traffic consideration
- ⬜ **Delivery Completion**
  - Driver marks orders as delivered in sequence

## � ORCDER FLOW

### Customer Side:
1. Customer adds items to cart
2. Customer goes to checkout
3. Customer places order (status: `pending`)
4. Customer waits for order acceptance
5. Customer receives notification when order is accepted/rejected
6. Customer tracks order status in Orders tab
7. Customer sees order completion

### Admin Side:
1. **Admin receives order notification** (real-time)
2. **Admin reviews order details** (items, customer, address)
3. **Admin accepts or rejects order**
   - If accepted: Status changes to `preparing`
   - If rejected: Status changes to `cancelled`, customer is notified
4. **Admin updates status** as order progresses:
   - `preparing` → Kitchen is making the food
   - `out_for_delivery` → Driver is on the way
   - `delivered` → Order completed
5. Admin can assign driver to order
6. Admin monitors all active orders
